## Website Description
This website is designed to be a text-based social media website for people to share their thoughts and opinions on a range of topics and to interact and engage with other users and their posts. Designing the website I intended to maximise the clarity and visibility of the user’s content and the ease and usability of interaction and navigation above all other considerations. 

The thinking behind this process was that as a social media site the content and the ease of creating, navigating and filtering that content would be integral to the user experience of the website. To pursue this ideal the website has several features aimed to elevate the importance and visibility of user’s posts and to allow them to view and interact with posts in a number of different ways.

### Design

#### Design Overview
There were two driving principles behind the design were firstly to create an environment in which there is a clear hierarchy of importance with user’s content and posts being foremost in importance and secondly to create an easily understandable and intuitive navigation and interaction interface.

#### Colour Scheme
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/shareflow-primary-colour-scheme.png)
#### Primary Colours
These three colours are the primary colours of the website, they make up the background colours of the majority of visual elements on the page. The three primary colours, are, as above in the image #FFFFFF, #89A6FB and #1B263B. 

#89A6FB is used as the main branding colour of the website. This colour was chosen as it’s a very calm colour that wouldn’t be too distracting or too eye-catching for the user. As well as that, as a purple shade, when it is combined with white text it creates a minimal and in my opinion very clean aesthetic. This aesthetic was something that I valued and placed importance on as creating a clean interface with clear hierarchical importance was something I valued in the design of this project. 

#FFFFFF, or plain white was used to highlight elements that were related of central importance to the user or the page that they were on. For instance, on the Home page, the elements that hold the most importance to the user were, the post-filtering and sorting options as well as the posts themselves. These elements, therefore, are primarily white, which when contrasted against #1B263B, a dark navy colour and the background colour of each page stand out very clearly and immediately pop into the eye of the user. 

As a user scrolls down the page or navigates through the website their eye is immediately drawn to the most important information and most important points of interaction which is a feature that was very important to achieve to help the user understand and feel comfortable using the site and browsing the site’s content.

![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/shareflow-topics-colour-scheme.png)

#### Secondary colours in use in the site exist to create a distinction between posts relating to different topics. I decided to undertake this route, with a clear visual cue indication the post’s topic as I believed that it could foster an almost subconscious and very quick understanding of a post’s content and allow a user who was scrolling through the website to quickly find posts that might interest them without necessarily having to use the filtering functionality.

#### Typography
The two fonts in use on the website are Montserrat and Libre Franklin. These two fonts are visibly distinct although both were chosen as clean, minimal and easy to read fonts. Montserrat is used throughout the site in areas that needed to be highlighted and set apart in times of importance and visibility. It is used in navigation elements, headings and titles as well as in form elements. Libre Franklin on the other hand is a more visually simple font and so is used in paragraph elements and other locations where the user would be expected to read a long section of text. 

#### Imagery
There aren’t many images used on the website. Following the idea of being more of a message board than a typical social media website, the features and functionality of the website are primarily centred around the sharing of ideas and text, as opposed to the sharing of imagery.
There are however user avatars and pictures. Whenever a user registers an account they are given a placeholder avatar. If they then go to the account page they can either choose a different avatar or enter a URL linking to an image that they wish to use. After they submit the form their account image will be updated and on any post that they make their image will be displayed. 

The user’s image is also displayed on the user’s account page itself, alongside some of the user’s profile statistics and information to encourage the user to create a sense of identity and ownership with the account.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

### Database Design / Data Modelling

The project uses a MongoDB nonrelational database to store its data. Data is stored across three collections, the Posts collection, the Users collection and the Topics collection.

#### Posts Collection

![Image of post collection object](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/post_data_object.PNG)

The posts collection is where all of the posts made by users are stored in the database. It uses MongoDB's ObjectId value as a unique identifier and stores all other details necessary to the display and tracking of the post in its data fields.

    id:             ObjectId: the unique identifier of each post object, generated by MongoDB  
    post_title:     string: contains the post's title, input by the user in the post creation form  
    post_content:   string: contains the post's text content, input by the user in the post creation form  
    topic_name:     string: contains the post's topic, selected by the user in post creation form represents an object of the topics collection  
    author:         string: contains the name of the author of the post, taken from the 'user' attribute of the session cookie  
    post_date:      string: contains the date and time that the post was created, generated 
                            using python's DateTime module and output in the MM:DD:YYYY, HH:MM:SS format  
    plusses:        int32:  contains the total tally of votes awarded by users, tracks the current
                            value so if a user changes their vote it will reduce by 1  
    total_comments: int32:  contains the tally of comments on the post  
    users_voted:    array:  contains a list of users who have voted on the post  
    comments:       array:  contains a list of comments made on the post  

    comment:        object: stored in the comments array  
       comment_id:      string: the unique identifier of the comment, generated by taking the post's 
                                id value and attaching the post's (total_comments + 1)  
       comment_content: string: contains the text content of the comment  
       author:          string: contains the name of the comment's author  
       post_date:       string: contains the date and time that the comment was created, generated 
                                using python's DateTime module and output in the MM:DD:YYYY, HH:MM:SS format 
 


#### Users Collection

![Image of users collection object](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/user_data_object.PNG)

The users collection is where all of the users account details and interaction history is stored. It is used to store a user's login details as well as account statistics and a history of the user's posts comments and votes.

    id:             ObjectId: the unique identifier of each user object, generated by MongoDB  
    username:       string: contains the user's username taken from the registration form  
    password:       string: contains the hashed value of the user's password, taken from the user registration form and hashed using werkzeug  
    voted:          array:  contains the list of posts that a user has voted on, whenever a user votes on a post
                            the post's id value is appended to this list  
    account_image:  string: contains the href location of the avatar selected by the user, or a URL if the user
                            has input a URL directly  
    directly_input_url: binary: this binary value states whether the user has input a URL as an avatar selection
                                or not used to inform the display of the avatar selection modal  
    registration_date: string: this field contains the date that the user registered their account, it is generated
                               using python's date module and is used to provide an account age to the user  
    posts_made:     int32:  contains the cumulative tally of posts that the user has made  
    comments_made:  int32: contains the cumulative tally of comments that the user has made  
    plusses:        int32: contains the active tally of plus votes that a user's posts have received  
    comments:       array: contains a list of comments made on the post 
    
    comment:        object: stored in the comments array  

       comment_id:      string: the unique identifier of the comment, generated by taking the post's id value and
                                attaching the post's (total_comments + 1)  
       comment_content: string: contains the text content of the comment  
       author:          string: contain
       s the name of the comment's author  
       post_date:       string: contains the date and time that the comment was created, generated using python's
                                DateTime module and output in the MM:DD:YYYY, HH:MM:SS format  
       attached_post:   string: contains the id value of the post that the comment is attached to  

#### Topics Collection

![Image of topics collection object](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/topic_data_object.PNG)

The topics collection and data record are currently very basic. I have included it in the website with the idea of developing it further in the future to allow for site administrator's to add new topics, edit topic details and so on.

## Features

### Home Page

![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/home_page.png)

The home page has two major roles. Firstly, its role is to introduce the user to the website and enable them to understand its purpose and functionality. Secondly, the home page is the primary means of exploring user’s posts and discovering new ideas and discussions.

To achieve the first goal I aimed to make the purpose of the home page as simple and clear as possible. Upon loading the page the user is presented with a column of posts down the centre of the page with a toolbar just above them with options to filter and sort. The user upon interacting with the scrollable list of posts will get an idea of the purpose of the site and will understand that this is an environment for creating and sharing posts.

The second goal of the home page to be the primary post navigation screen is achieved by utilising several smaller features to make the functionality of viewing and exploring posts as convenient and intuitive as possible.

### Post Filter and Sort Toolbar
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/filter-feature.PNG)

At the top of the home page is a toolbar containing two dropdown options that allow users to customise the appearance and display of posts to improve the page’s practical usability and make it more user friendly. The User can both sort and filter the posts displayed. The options for sorting posts are to sort by date created, which is the default setting of the page and which will display the newest posts at the top of the page with older ones chronologically below it, or by most popular. The Most popular sort uses the voting system attached to each post and sorts the posts from most votes tallied to least. This is a very useful tool to find the most interesting or engaging posts as opposed to just the newest and can provide a very different post browsing experience.
The filter options for the posts, allow the user to display all of the posts, across all topics, or by one of the five topics provided. The five topics being Sports, Entertainment, Global News, Politics and General Thoughts. This filtering function allows the user to explore posts relating to one topic that may interest them in particular and increases the usefulness of the post display.

### Pagination 
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/pagination-features.PNG)

The home page makes use of pagination to display only a certain number of posts at a time to the user. It does this for a couple of reasons. Number one, instead of displaying all of the posts initially and forcing the user’s browser to load them all at once, which would be increasingly impractical if there was a large number of posts it will load the posts 10 at a time to lower the demand on the browser. Number two it will allow a user to easily navigate back and forth between the pages to find posts that they like without having to scroll and search for the post.

### Create post floating action button
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/fab-feature.PNG)

This floating action button is a fixed element on the bottom right of the screen. Since it is fixed it will stay in position even as a user scrolls down the page. When the user hovers over the button a label will appear with the text ‘Create a Post’, and when the user clicks the button the page will be redirected directly to the Create a Post page. This button is there to add another option to navigate to the post creation page and provides an option for mobile users to create a post without having to reach the top of the screen which can be inconvenient and unergonomic.

### Create post page
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/create_post_page.png)

The create post page is very simple and consists of a single form titled ‘Post Details’. The form is where the user can input the details of the post. The form contains an input box for the title, a Textarea input for the post content and a dropdown selection for the post topic. The dropdown selection is populated with the five topics available. To ensure that the website’s posts both maintain a consistent size on the page as well as to ensure that the posts maintain a reasonable standard of effort there are minimum character requirements for both the title and the post content. When the user submits the page they will automatically be directed to the home page and the newest posts.

### Edit Post Page
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/edit_post_page.png)

The edit post page is similar to the create post page, it contains a form in the same format and styling. When a user selects the option to edit their post, the page loads with the existing details of the post prefilled and editable. When the user has edited the post to their satisfaction they can submit and they will be redirected to the posts details page for that post.


### 404 Page
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/404_page.png)

If a user attempts to navigate to a page that either does not exist or has been deleted the flask routing will redirect them to the 404 response page. This page is very basic and acts as a landing page in the case of a load error. It consists of a header text explaining that the page the user has tried to load doesn’t exist and a subheading providing a countdown to when the page will automatically redirect to the home page. The subheading also contains a link to the home page in the case that the page does not automatically redirect. 

### Sign in / Registration Page 

![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/sign_in_page.png)
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/register_page.png)

The sign in and registration pages are mirrored versions of themselves. They consist of a central card containing a form, in the case of the sign-in page, consisting of two input fields one for their username and one for their password and in the case of the registration form three fields one for their desired username, one for their intended password and another to repeat their password for validation. In the case that the user submits a username that is not available or that they submit passwords that are not matching they will receive a validation message informing them that their input does not meet the requirements. 

### Post Details Page
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/post_details_page.png)

The post details page is where a post is displayed when a user selects the ‘View Post’ option from either their profile or from the home page. The page contains the same information as the regular post view with the basic post details as well as the voting button. Additionally, there is a close button on the top right of the card which will return the user to the page that they were on remembering the pagination status of that page.

As well as the post details the page contains a comment section that will display the total comment count if there are any otherwise it will display a placeholder message. The section contains a form where a user can submit a comment and then below that the comments of the post are displayed in chronological order starting with the oldest.


### Account Page
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/account_page.png)

The user’s account page is unique to them and generated using data gathered from their interaction with the website and with other user’s posts. The page consists of two sections, the first is the account details section where the user’s username is displayed along with their avatar or chosen image and a display of some statistics relating to the user’s engagement with the website. 
The second section is the post display container. The post display container consists of a toggleable display that will either display the posts authored by the user, which is the default display or the posts ‘plussed’ by the user. The idea behind the toggleable display is to allow the user to view their posts or to view the posts that they had plussed. This is a useful feature that practically allows a user to save posts that they want to view again in the future simply by voting for it.

### Account details
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/account_details.PNG)

This is the account details display, it takes values from the user’s database record to inform the total posts made total comments and total votes received. It also displays the length of time since the account was registered.


### Display tab
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/display_tab.PNG)

There are two display tabs one for users posts and one for posts that the user has voted for. They are displayed in paginated lists and the page will only display one tab at a time. To ensure the user experience is as seamless and intuitive as possible the page will remember the status of both pagination lists as well as the active tab whenever the page reloads or a user navigates back to the page from the post details page.

### Avatar Selection
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/avatar_select.PNG)

Whenever the user clicks on the account image in the account details section of their account page, a modal will display with a radio selection option of either selecting one of a number of provided avatars or selecting the option to input a URL that leads to an image of their choice. The URL input will automatically validate that the URL relates to an image and that the URL loads an image successfully. If it does not, the user will be alerted that the URL they entered is not valid. This avatar will be displayed on all posts authored by the user to create a sense of a community of people as opposed to just anonymous posts.

### Flash messages
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/flash_message.PNG)

Whenever a user takes an action that causes the page to update or reload such as commenting, editing a post, signing in, sign out etc. The page will display a message in the centre of the screen informing the user of the success or the failure of the action.

### Post Card
![Image of responsive page mockups](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/post-feature.PNG)

The Post card itself is the primary way in which a post is displayed. The post contains a plus that can be clicked on to vote on the post, this will also enable the post to be displayed in the plussed posts tab of the user’s account page. It also contains a button that will navigate the user to the post details page for that post where the post's comments can be seen and comments can be made. 

If the user is the author of the post in the top right-hand corner of the card there will be a cog icon displayed, that, when clicked will display a dropdown menu containing the post's edit and delete options.

### Logical routing behaviour
There are some interactions with the site that in order to provide a satisfying and logical experience for the user needs to recall the user’s previous actions. The most complex example of this is when a user on their account page changes the active tab of the account page and changes the active page of the pagination menu, then proceeds to navigate into the post details page of a post and open up the edit post page for that post. In this instance, the website will recall the previous user’s path to the page and the account page’s pagination and tab arguments from when the user was last on the page. To ensure a satisfying user experience the page will return the user to the post details page when the edit page is closed and then return the user to the account page with the correct pagination status and with the correct tab open when the user closes the post details page.

### Bugs Discovered 

1.
The first bug that I will highlight is an issue that arose regarding the display of plussed posts on the account page. The issue, as seen in the image below that arose was that the number of posts that were being displayed on the individual paginated pages was inconsistent and often less than the designated number.

![Image of posts per paginated page issue](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/account_plussed_issue.PNG)

After investigating the issue I figured out that issue was arising because of how the posts were being displayed. In order to not display the posts that the user had authored and then plussed in the plussed tab as well as in the authored posts tab, a conditional statement was being implemented before the jinja templating rendered the post as seen in the following code block.

    {% for post in userPlusses%}
      {% if post.author != session['user'] %}
         <div class="post-card">

While this code had the desired effect of displaying all of the plussed posts except for the self-authored ones it was causing an issue as the self-authored posts were still included in the original list that was then sliced to create the smaller lists for pagination purposes. This was resulting in the shortened list that was to be displayed as one page of posts and that was supposed to be 10 posts long potentially having no displayable posts.

Once the problem and its cause were fully known the fix was straightforward enough. It involved iterating through the list of plussed posts in the original python function, and if the posts were not self-authored then they would be added to a list that was then used to created the paginated lists and output by the function and rendered on the page.

    userPlusses = []
    postsPlussed = list(
          mongo.db.posts.find({"users_voted": session["user"]})
    for post in postsPlussed:
          if post[author] != session['user']:
                userPlusses.append(post)

2. 
Another bug that I encountered and will highlight was a bug that was relating to the handling of a database update request. It was a small issue but required some figuring out none the less. The issue was caused by attempting to add a comment to a post which would result in the page failing to reload and presenting an error message.

![Image of error message on add comment attempt](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/comments_object_issue.PNG)

After examining the error message which stated that "the field 'comments' must be an array but is of type object." I looked into the structure of the post object and the comments field. As the error message stated it was the incorrect type and that was causing an issue because the manner in which the new comment was being added was with a '$push' operator which works by adding an item to an array. By simply changing the comments field of the post object from

```
post = {
        ...
        'comments': {},
        ...
        }
```

to 

```
post = {
        ...
        'comments': [],
        ...
        }
```

it allowed for a new comment to be pushed to the array and stored in the field. The page would then load successfully and allow for comments to be added once again.


## Deployment

### To Publish to Heroku
Before publishing to Heroku it was necessary to set up two files to enable Heroku to run the project correctly. These are the requirements.txt which inform Heroku what dependencies are needed to run the website and the Procfile which informs Heroku what file is needed to start the project and how. To create these files the following command line commands are used.

    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile

Following the creation of these files, it is now possible to deploy the project to Heroku.
Begin by logging in to your Heroku account and navigating to the dashboard. From the dashboard select the New button and the New App option in the dropdown menu.

![Image of the New app dropdown menu](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/deploy_1.PNG)

In the form that then appears enter the project's name and select the appropriate region for your circumstance. Then select the Create app button.

![Image of the app settings form](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/deploy_2.PNG)

In the deployment tab then scroll down to the deployment method section and select the Github option. 

![Image of the deployment options](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/deploy_3.PNG)

So long as you have your GitHub account linked to your Heroku account you can then enter the repository name in the input field and click the connect button next to the correct repository after searching.

![Image of the repository search field](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/deploy_4.PNG)

After connecting to the repository navigate to the Settings tab and the config vars section. Click the reveal config vars and input the variables from your applications env.py file.

![Image of the config vars section](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/deploy_7.PNG)

After adding the config vars navigate to the deploy tab and enable automatic updates and then click the deploy branch button in the manual deploy section.

![Image of the manual deploy button](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/deploy_8.PNG)

The project will then be successfully hosted on Heroku and can be accessed by clicking the Open App button.

### To Connect your Database to the Project


To connect your project to the MongoDB cluster, log in to your MongoDB account and navigate to the overview tab of the cluster you wish to connect.

![Image of the overview tab](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/mongo_deploy_1.PNG)

![Image of the connect tab](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/mongo_deploy_2.PNG)

Click the connect button on the right-hand side of the page and then select the 'Connect your application' option.

![Image of the connect your application button](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/mongo_deploy_3.PNG)

Fill in the correct options for driver and version, in this project's case, it is Python and the latest version.

![Image of the connection settings](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/mongo_deploy_4.PNG)

Then edit the database name and password variables in the URI string that is presented below to match your project's details.

![Image of the database uri](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/mongo_deploy_5.PNG)

Copy the string and input it in the field for MONGO_URI in your env.py file and Heroku config var settings

![Image of the config var field for mongo_uri](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/shareflow-milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/mongo_deploy_6.PNG)

Then create an instance of pymongo in your app.py file by entering  
     
    mongo = PyMongo(app)
